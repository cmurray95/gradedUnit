# HND Graded Unit - Pet rating application.

# Files for marking
Everything in Server folder and everything under /src/app in gradedUnit-src are to be assessed.

# Install guide
Ensure that nodeJS is installed on system https://nodejs.org/, then from the Server folder run npm install followed by npm start.
Do the same again from within the gradedUnit-src folder.

Once running, visit localhost:4200 to begin.

# Notes
Due to external influences I was unable to get the image uploader working as intended, however future commits look to fix this issue.

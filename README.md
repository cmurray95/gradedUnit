# HND Graded Unit - Pet rating application.

# Files for marking
Everything in Server folder and everything under /src/app in gradedUnit-src are to be assessed.

# Install guide
Ensure that nodeJS and MongoDB server are installed on system: https://nodejs.org/ https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community.
From the Server folder run npm install followed by npm start.
In a second terminal, run the same commands from within gradedUnit-src.


Once running, visit localhost:4200 to begin.

# Notes
Due to external influences I was unable to get the image uploader working as intended, however future commits look to fix this issue.
